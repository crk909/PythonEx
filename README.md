# PythonEx
Personal python code created out of interest

# Kattis
Some of the code I have written as solutions for kattis.com, a coding problem website

This is the website we used for competitive programming at the University, but the solutions 
 for those problems are not here, as they were created on an account provided for competition
 
 These are just the problems I solved on my own for personal learning.
 Some are VERY simple such as carrots.py, but some are a bit more interesting
       wheresmyinternet.py (https://open.kattis.com/problems/wheresmyinternet) 
       shortestpath1.py (https://open.kattis.com/problems/shortestpath1)
